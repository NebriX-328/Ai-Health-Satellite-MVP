AI-Driven Satellite Health Monitoring System

Overview
The AI-Driven Satellite Health Monitoring System is an intelligent platform designed to predict, detect, and prevent satellite failures by leveraging machine learning, anomaly detection, and real-time telemetry analysis.
Satellites are critical for communication, navigation, Earth observation, and scientific exploration — yet they operate in harsh, unpredictable space environments. Traditional diagnostic systems often react to failures after they occur. Our solution aims to change that by enabling predictive maintenance, automated anomaly detection, and actionable decision support to significantly extend satellite lifespan and reduce mission risks.

Problem Statement
With the growing number of satellites in orbit, maintaining their health and ensuring mission longevity is a significant challenge. Current satellite health monitoring techniques are mostly manual, reactive, and fragmented, resulting in:

Late detection of component degradation
Unexpected mission failures
Costly delays and maintenance operations

Our solution proposes an AI-powered predictive monitoring system to enable proactive satellite management.

Objectives
Predictive Health Monitoring: Use ML models to forecast failures and degradation trends.
Anomaly Detection: Identify abnormal behavior in real-time satellite telemetry.
Decision Support: Recommend corrective actions to operators before issues escalate.
Visualization Dashboard: Provide real-time insights into satellite performance.
Training & Simulation Mode: Help students and engineers explore satellite fault scenarios.
